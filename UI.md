# System Workflows
## Workflow 1: App Bootstrap
1. Request enters via `public/index.php`, loads autoloader, bootstraps `bootstrap/app.php` (files: `public/index.php`, `bootstrap/app.php`).
2. App registers routing and middleware aliases and loads providers (files: `bootstrap/app.php`, `bootstrap/providers.php`).
3. Routes map to controllers/views through `routes/web.php` and `routes/auth.php` (files: `routes/web.php`, `routes/auth.php`, `app/Http/Controllers`).
4. Layout rendering uses AdminLTE and Vite assets (files: `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`, `resources/views/vendor/adminlte/page.blade.php`, `resources/css/app.css`, `resources/js/app.js`, `vite.config.js`).
5. Client JS initializes Alpine and theme/particles behavior (files: `resources/js/app.js`, `resources/js/theme.js`, `resources/js/particles.js`).

## Workflow 2: Authentication (Register -> Login -> Verify -> Logout)
1. User navigates from landing page to `/login` or `/register` via welcome links (files: `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`, `routes/auth.php`).
2. GET `/register` shows AdminLTE register template; POST `/register` creates User, assigns `user` role, logs in (files: `resources/views/auth/register.blade.php`, `resources/views/vendor/adminlte/auth/register.blade.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisteredUserController.php`, `app/Models/User.php`).
3. POST `/login` validates `LoginRequest`, authenticates session guard, redirects to dashboard (files: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php`, `app/Http/Requests/Auth/LoginRequest.php`, `config/auth.php`).
4. Email verification prompt/verification routes enforce signed + throttled verification flow (files: `routes/auth.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/EmailVerificationPromptController.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/VerifyEmailController.php`).
5. Logout clears session and redirects to `/` (files: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php`, `routes/auth.php`).
6. Error handling uses broker responses and validation exceptions (files: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/NewPasswordController.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/PasswordResetLinkController.php`).

## Workflow 3: Customer Onboarding (Customer -> Contacts)
1. User opens `/customers` from AdminLTE menu or dashboard quick actions (files: `config/adminlte.php`, `resources/views/dashboard.blade.php`, `routes/web.php`).
2. GET `/customers` loads paginated customers; create button links to `/customers/create` (files: `app/Http/Controllers/CustomerController.php`, `resources/views/customers/index.blade.php`).
3. POST `/customers` validates and creates a Customer (files: `app/Http/Requests/StoreCustomerRequest.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/CustomerController.php`, `app/Models/Customer.php`).
4. Customer details at `/customers/{customer}` load related contacts; contact CRUD under `/customers/{customer}/contacts/*` (files: `app/Http/Controllers/CustomerController.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/CustomerContactController.php`, `resources/views/customers/show.blade.php`, `resources/views/customers/contacts/index.blade.php`).
5. Permission checks enforced by `permission:customers.*` and `permission:contacts.*` plus role middleware (files: `app/Http/Controllers/CustomerController.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/CustomerContactController.php`, `routes/web.php`).

## Workflow 4: Project Setup -> Kickoff
1. User navigates to `/projects` and opens `/projects/create` (files: `resources/views/projects/index.blade.php`, `routes/web.php`).
2. POST `/projects` creates Project, syncs products, dispatches drive folder job, and triggers board provisioning on model create (files: `app/Http/Controllers/ProjectController.php`, `app/Http/Requests/StoreProjectRequest.php`, `app/Jobs/CreateProjectDriveFolders.php`, `app/Models/Project.php`, `app/Services/ProjectBoardProvisioner.php`).
3. Project overview `/projects/{project}` provides module navigation to kickoff flows (files: `resources/views/projects/show.blade.php`, `resources/views/projects/partials/modules-nav.blade.php`).
4. Kickoff plan/schedule/complete screens enforce state transitions in controller (files: `app/Http/Controllers/ProjectKickoffController.php`, `resources/views/projects/kickoffs/plan.blade.php`, `resources/views/projects/kickoffs/schedule.blade.php`, `resources/views/projects/kickoffs/complete.blade.php`).
5. Scheduling sends emails via Mailables; reschedules send a different email (files: `app/Http/Controllers/ProjectKickoffController.php`, `app/Mail/ProjectKickoffScheduledMail.php`, `app/Mail/ProjectKickoffRescheduledMail.php`, `resources/views/emails/project_kickoff_scheduled.blade.php`, `resources/views/emails/project_kickoff_rescheduled.blade.php`).
6. Error states include "already planned/completed" checks and redirects (file: `app/Http/Controllers/ProjectKickoffController.php`).

## Workflow 5: Requirements Import -> RFP Generation
1. User opens `/projects/{project}/requirements` from module nav (files: `resources/views/projects/partials/modules-nav.blade.php`, `routes/web.php`).
2. Module tabs trigger AJAX load of requirements list partial (files: `resources/views/projects/requirements/index.blade.php`, `resources/views/projects/requirements/partials/list.blade.php`).
3. Transcript import at `/requirements/import` uploads a file and POSTs to `/requirements/import/preview`, invoking Gemini extraction (files: `resources/views/projects/requirements/import.blade.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/ProjectRequirementController.php`, `app/Services/GeminiClient.php`).
4. Approved imports POST to `/requirements/import` and persist `ProjectRequirement` records (files: `app/Http/Controllers/ProjectRequirementController.php`, `app/Http/Requests/StoreProjectRequirementImportRequest.php`, `app/Models/ProjectRequirement.php`).
5. RFP generation POST `/requirements/rfp` queues `GenerateProjectRfpDocument`, which calls Gemini for sections and builds a DOCX from template (files: `app/Jobs/GenerateProjectRfpDocument.php`, `app/Services/GeminiClient.php`, `app/Services/RfpDocumentBuilder.php`, `resources/templates/rfp-template.docx`).
6. Download route `/requirements/rfp/{rfp_document}` streams the generated file from local storage (files: `app/Http/Controllers/ProjectRequirementController.php`, `app/Models/RfpDocument.php`).
7. Error states include transcript parsing failures and missing requirements/files (files: `app/Http/Controllers/ProjectRequirementController.php`, `app/Jobs/GenerateProjectRfpDocument.php`).

## Workflow 6: Drive Documents (Folders -> Upload -> Manage)
1. User opens `/projects/{project}/drive-documents`; controller ensures Drive folders exist or queues creation (files: `app/Http/Controllers/DocumentController.php`, `app/Jobs/CreateProjectDriveFolders.php`, `resources/views/projects/drive-documents/index.blade.php`).
2. Create folder POST `/drive-documents/folders` dispatches `CreateDriveFolder` to DriveService (files: `app/Http/Controllers/DocumentController.php`, `app/Jobs/CreateDriveFolder.php`, `app/Services/DriveService.php`).
3. Upload POST `/drive-documents/upload` stores a local temp file and queues `UploadDriveDocument`; job persists Document record (files: `app/Http/Controllers/DocumentController.php`, `app/Jobs/UploadDriveDocument.php`, `app/Models/Document.php`).
4. Rename/move/copy/delete actions dispatch jobs and enforce policies (files: `app/Http/Controllers/DocumentController.php`, `app/Policies/DocumentPolicy.php`, `app/Jobs/RenameDriveDocument.php`, `app/Jobs/MoveDriveDocument.php`, `app/Jobs/CopyDriveDocument.php`, `app/Jobs/TrashDriveDocument.php`).
5. Error states warn when Drive folders are not ready or when accessing trash folders (file: `app/Http/Controllers/DocumentController.php`).

## Workflow 7: Kanban Delivery (Stories -> Testing -> Bugs)
1. User visits `/projects/{project}/kanban`; boards are ensured and listed (files: `app/Http/Controllers/Kanban/KanbanBoardController.php`, `app/Services/ProjectBoardProvisioner.php`, `resources/views/kanban/index.blade.php`).
2. Board view `/kanban/boards/{board}` loads columns, stories or testing cards, and filters (files: `app/Http/Controllers/Kanban/KanbanBoardController.php`, `app/Models/ProjectBoardColumn.php`, `resources/views/kanban/show.blade.php`).
3. Stories are created via POST `/stories` using IssueKeyGenerator and initial status history (files: `app/Http/Controllers/Kanban/KanbanStoryController.php`, `app/Services/IssueKeyGenerator.php`, `app/Models/StoryStatusHistory.php`).
4. Moving stories enforces validation rules (assignee, description, confirmations, blocker reason, testing pass) and records history (files: `app/Http/Controllers/Kanban/KanbanStoryController.php`, `app/Models/TestingCard.php`, `app/Models/StoryStatusHistory.php`).
5. Send-to-testing creates/updates TestingCard on testing board (files: `app/Http/Controllers/Kanban/KanbanStoryController.php`, `app/Models/TestingCard.php`, `app/Services/ProjectBoardProvisioner.php`).
6. Recording test results moves stories to Completed or creates Bugs and moves to Blocker (files: `app/Http/Controllers/Kanban/KanbanTestingCardController.php`, `app/Models/Bug.php`, `app/Models/StoryStatusHistory.php`).
7. Board document generation uses KanbanDocumentBuilder and stores BoardDocument records (files: `app/Http/Controllers/Kanban/KanbanBoardDocumentController.php`, `app/Services/KanbanDocumentBuilder.php`, `app/Models/BoardDocument.php`).
8. Permissions enforced by `permission:kanban.*` middleware and role middleware in routes (files: `app/Http/Controllers/Kanban/KanbanBoardController.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/Kanban/KanbanStoryController.php`, `routes/web.php`).

# Gaps / Uncertain Areas
- `resources/views/layouts/navigation.blade.php` and related nav components appear unused in current views; unclear if intended to replace AdminLTE navigation (Inferred from lack of references in `resources/views` and menu config in `config/adminlte.php`).
- `app/View/Components/KanbanLayout.php` and `resources/views/components/kanban-layout.blade.php` exist but are not referenced by kanban screens (Inferred from lack of `<x-kanban-layout>` usage in `resources/views`).
- `resources/views/components/modal.blade.php` exists but no `<x-modal>` usage found in app views (Inferred from component definition and lack of references in `resources/views`).
- `resources/views/projects/drive-documents/partials/folder-tree.blade.php` only self-includes; index view does not reference it (Inferred from file contents and lack of references in `resources/views/projects/drive-documents/index.blade.php`).
- Only `routes/web.php`, `routes/auth.php`, and `routes/console.php` exist; no `routes/api.php` found (Inferred from `routes` directory listing).
