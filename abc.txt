1:40 - Latish Menghani
  No, no, I said I sent you those files because that's our major primary testing thing.

1:48 - Vicrum V
  Yeah.

1:49 - Latish Menghani
  So, there's a full, like, it's called a PWTA.

1:52 - Viral Parmar (Fiscal Ox)
  It's called Private World Testing Act.

1:54 - Latish Menghani
  I sent you a format of that, but each test, I should have an option to, like... I each test, know, like that's why I send it to you.  Like that's the main thing. And then if somebody goes in and says, I want, you know, only one test, I should be able to select like only one test, you know, from there, from that module.  Got it? Yes. Yeah. Okay.

2:16 - Vicrum V
  We do have that option. So that should be okay. All right. I'm sorry, Tavad.

2:21 - Latish Menghani
  You can go ahead now.

2:25 - Vicrum V
  Okay.

2:26 - Viral Parmar (Fiscal Ox)
  first of all, today's kickoff call, uh, goal is to, uh, explain the, is the workflow of your laboratory and how the, uh, sample has been, uh, taken and what, uh, kind of, uh, workflow you are following up.  And what are the documents needed from our site? I mean, your site to get, uh, data and all those things.  Okay. So first of all, we, uh, talk about your current work. So how do you manage the order you are receiving?  Like how you are receiving the orders? Like it is on contract-based or single? No, it comes from phones.

3:18 - Latish Menghani
  It is contract-based also. There's some contract-based. There's some phone orders and some email, like a few email, like one or two maybe, you know?

3:33 - Viral Parmar (Fiscal Ox)
  So the client will call and say, hey, I'm selling my home, okay? I'm buying my home.

3:40 - Latish Menghani
  Or I put a new well in. know, new wells is also getting tested. So the client will say, you know, and these are all clients who use well water for their drinking purposes, okay?  So they're like, they're potable water. So they would call. Call us and say, hey, you know, we're selling our home.  We need to water test it, okay? Or a realtor would call and say, hey, I have a buyer or seller who wants to get this water tested.  A builder would call and say, hey, I'm building a house and it says, well, water, we need to get our water tested.  So that's how we get the calls. Okay.

4:26 - Viral Parmar (Fiscal Ox)
  So is there any scheduled meeting? I mean, scheduled sample collection? Yes, I do the scheduling.

4:35 - Latish Menghani
  So, for example, I have three guys, right, on the road. Then I would schedule it according to the mapping, okay?  So we're supposed, like, you know, I have one guy going into a certain different municipality and then the other guy will go into a different municipality, okay?  So, like, scheduling would be according to me, you know, like I just schedule. There's three people on the road or four people on the road, you know, because of the holidays, I have only two people on the road, which is fine because the other two are on vacation.  So I'll just schedule two people on the road today. And then like one person is doing, you know, four or five jobs.  The other one is doing four or five jobs, but they're separate areas. So like one is going to Salem County.  The other one is going to Burlington County. And then when they come back at the end of the day, they bring the samples back, you know.  The samples would be those PWTA samples that I sent you, or it would be like only one test at one point.

5:38 - Vicrum V
  You know what mean?

5:39 - Latish Menghani
  So let me see if I'm repeating this.

5:42 - Vicrum V
  So you get a phone or a phone call or email and, you know, someone wants to get their well tested.  And so from that point onwards, you go on to scheduling. So you schedule the call and let's say you got two, three calls.  And you're scheduling all those calls in different locations based on a certain time. Right, right. What are the important parts in making that decision of how to schedule that call?

6:15 - Latish Menghani
  Okay, so the important part is going to be why somebody calling for a water test, right? So the secretary will ask the questions like, you know, they'll say, hi, this is, you know, Wineland Environmental Laboratories, and, you know, we're a state-certified lab.  It's like, yeah, we need our water. So they're going to say, they're going to ask you why, you know, what do you need the testing for, okay?  So it's either going to be for a certificate of occupancy, okay? It's going to be for, you know, like I said, sale of a home or something.  And then, so we have a place where we write down resale, you know, we market. And I send you that field sheet.  It's on the bottom. says, you know, there's areas where it says, you know, what it. The reason for the testing or purpose of testing, okay.  So the purpose of testing is going to be marked, okay. And then it's going to be the client name, okay.  The client address, the phone number, the email we get, okay. Then we're going to get the property address, okay.  Sometimes the mailing address and the property address are different. So property address. And then we look up the blocked and lot automatically from the website, okay.  So we just get the property address, the municipalities, okay. And then, and then we, you know, we tell, we give them a time.  There's a specific time. For example, we have a schedule. Like Monday, Monday, we're going to go to Cumberland County.  Tuesday, we're going to go to Atlantic County. So we have like a municipalities. And we have schedules according to the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  So we have timings according to the counties where we go. Okay.

7:56 - Vicrum V
  So we schedule. Yes.

8:00 - Latish Menghani
  Okay. So she gives her time right away because you know exactly what... She doesn't give exact time, but she gives a narrow period, like a two-hour window, you know, so.  Okay. All right. But yeah, she does give a two-hour window, you know. But sometimes the client would say, you know, is it possible for me to do in the afternoon?  Then she'll give a two-hour window in the afternoon, you know. And then I just got to adjust it according to the schedule, you know what mean, so.  Okay. Okay. I'm thinking like something like a calendar view with all the schedules where you can see it.

8:34 - Vicrum V
  Yeah. Okay. Okay.

8:38 - Latish Menghani
  Okay. Then what happens?

8:40 - Vicrum V
  What's the next step? Okay. So once that is done, then the field sheet is created.

8:45 - Latish Menghani
  Okay. That field sheet will be given to, with the chain of custody. So there's a field sheet and a chain, which I sent you on the Excel sheet.  That field sheet and the chain is getting created. Okay. Those two sheets then go to the sample. Bottle Prep, guys, okay?  They prep the bottles the day before. So for example, Monday's schedule would be done Friday, but Tuesday, tomorrow's schedule will be done Monday night.  So Monday night, the bottle prep guy is going to tell me what is the schedule for tomorrow. And then I'll give him three sets, okay?  And then he'll go to the three, the three sets will include, basically each job will include a field sheet and a chain of capacity, okay?  So two papers, all right?

9:32 - Vicrum V
  Those two papers are going to go to bottle prep. They're going to prep the bottles.

9:35 - Latish Menghani
  They're going to put it in a box for each person. Now they're going to go on the road. The field guys are going to come in the morning, okay?  The technician, the morning person is going to do all the equipment calibration. So there's equipment calibration for the pH meter and for the chlorine meter, okay?  Those two meters have to get calibrated every day. In the morning, before the field guys leave. They take the pH meter, they take the chlorine meter, they take the GPS meter with them, okay?  So these three meters are taken by the field guys with the two sheets, which are the field sheet and the chain of custody.  They go on the road. The first, suppose the first job is a private world testing act, like a sale of a home, okay?  They go to the property, okay? They'll run the kitchen sink for 15 minutes, okay? While they're running the water, they're going to do the GPS, okay, of the property, which is from the front door, okay?  They're going to go in the basement. They're going to see if there's a water treatment system, okay? If there is a water treatment system, they'll take a sample prior to the water treatment system, and then they'll take a sample after the water treatment system, okay?  So there'll be two samples taken, okay? They both can go on the same field sheet, okay? So there's a proper, there's a chain of custody has...  One section called raw, one section called treated, okay? Now, if there's no treatment, it's only going to be the top part, which is the raw sampling, okay?  The raw sampling is the one which goes to the state of New Jersey, okay? The treated sampling is for just own information, county information, and the CO information.  So any water test which fails need to get passed. So if we take only the raw sample, which is from the, before the treatment, it'll fail.  So we take raw and treated at the same time, so that when the customer gets the report, it's a passing report, they get a CO, they get done, okay?  So they don't have to do anything. Because they already have a system correcting certain stuff, you know, which they already know.
